Password complexity checker 

A **Password Complexity Checker** is a tool designed to evaluate the strength and security of a password based on specific criteria. It assesses various factors to determine how resistant a password is to being guessed or cracked. Here are the key components and features:

 Key Features:

1. **Length Requirement**: Checks if the password meets a minimum length (commonly at least 8 characters).

2. **Character Variety**:
   - **Uppercase Letters**: Ensures the presence of at least one uppercase letter (A-Z).
   - **Lowercase Letters**: Ensures the presence of at least one lowercase letter (a-z).
   - **Numbers**: Verifies the inclusion of at least one digit (0-9).
   - **Special Characters**: Checks for the presence of special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*).

3. **Strength Assessment**: Based on the criteria met, the checker categorizes the password strength into levels such as:
   - Very Weak
   - Weak
   - Moderate
   - Strong
   - Very Strong

4. **User Feedback**: Provides specific feedback on which criteria the password meets or fails, helping users understand how to improve their password security.

### Purpose:
The primary goal of a Password Complexity Checker is to encourage users to create strong passwords that enhance security, reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access to accounts and sensitive information.
